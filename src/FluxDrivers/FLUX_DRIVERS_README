\package FluxDrivers

\brief   The package provides flux drivers for some commonly 
         used fluxes.

         Within the GENIE framework each neutrino flux driver 
         is a concrete implementation of the GFluxI interface.
         The concrete GFluxI object is passed to GMCJob (the
         GENIE MC job driver) at the job initialization.

         This package also serves as a template showing how to
         add your own flux driver.

  To be able to use this flux driver you will need to download
  the flux data from:  http://lxmi.mi.infn.it/~battist/neutrino.html

  The flux describes the energy and zenith angle distributions of 
  numu, numubar, nue and nuebar at various sites.
  The neutrinos are generated at the surface of a sphere, with radius
  equal to the input longitudinal radius Rl. surrounding the detector
  [at (0,0,0)]. The generated positions are randomly displaced at the 
  plane that is perpendicular to the sphere at the generated point.
  (so that the generated neutrinos are properly distrubuted within the
  detector and not all pointing towards the origin). The scale of the 
  transverse displacement is governed by the input transverse radius Rt.
  The user can select not to input some of the 4 input files (one for
  each neutrino species) and which case generation of the corresponding
  neutrino species will be inhibited. You must input at least one 
  flux data file.
