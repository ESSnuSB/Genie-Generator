The FluxDrivers package provides flux drivers for some commonly used 
neutrino fluxes.

ACCELERATOR NEUTRINO FLUX DRIVERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENIE flux drivers for modern accelerator neutrino sources.
Those flux drivers typically depend on the flux ntuples generated by the
experiment-specific beam simulations (eg jnubeam, gnumi etc)

ATMOSPHERIC NEUTRINO FLUX DRIVERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENIE flux drivers for popular atmospheric neutrino flux = f(E,costheta) 
simulations at various sites (Kamioka, Soudan, ...).
The flux driver depends on files provided by the atmospheric neutrino 
flux simulation authors in order to determine the angular and energy 
dependence. The position of each flux neutrino [going towards a detector 
centered at (0,0,0)] is generated uniformly on a plane that is 
perpendicular to a sphere of radius Rl at the point that is determined
by the generated neutrino direction (theta,phi). The size of that plane
is determined by the transverse radius Rt. You can tweak Rl, Rt to match
the size of your detector.

\driver
  genie::flux::GCylindTH1Flux 
\brief
  A simple but gighly configurable GENIE flux driver. 
  Generates a 'cylindrical' neutrino beam along the input direction, 
  with the input transverse radius and centered at the input beam spot 
  position. The energies are generated from the input energy spectrum 
  (TH1D) Multiple neutrino species can be generated (you will need to 
  supply an energy spectrum for each).


\driver
  genie::flux::GMonoEnergeticFlux 
\brief
  A simple GENIE flux driver for monoenergetic neutrinos along the
  z direction. Can handle a mix of neutrinos with their corresponding
  weight. This trivial flux driver was added in so that single energy
  neutrinos can be easily used with the event generation driver that
  can handle a target mix or detailed geometries.
